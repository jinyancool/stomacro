# Welcome {.unnumbered}

We are grateful to all patients and clinicians who contributed to this study. This work was designed to serve three primary audiences: (i) clinicians managing oral cancer, (ii) genomicists and bioinformatics researchers, and (iii) investigators seeking to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of oral cavity malignancies. The Results section therefore prioritizes concise, clinically actionable findings, including subtype prevalence, defining molecular features, prognostic associations, subtype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities, and prioritized candidate targets, with the aim of accelerating precision oncology approaches in this population.

## Reproducible Research and Open Science

Reproducibility of the entire analytical workflow was a central objective of this study, with particular attention to the needs of the genomics and bioinformatics communities. A dedicated, version-controlled companion repository[ ](https://github.com/%5Byour-repo%5D/OSCC_Chinese_Cohort_Subtyping) is provided alongside this manuscript. The repository contains:

-   Fully scripted, end-to-end bioinformatics workflows implemented in Nextflow/Snakemake and R/Python
-   Exhaustive documentation of data preprocessing and quality-control procedures
-   Exact software versions, complete dependency lists, and containerized environments (Docker/Singularity) where applicable
-   All parameter settings and random seeds used
-   Intermediate and final datasets sufficient for bit-for-bit replication of results

These resources enable any qualified research group to independently regenerate virtually all figures, tables, and statistical results reported herein when starting from the same raw or processed input data.

We deliberately adopted a policy of complete codebase openness, acknowledging that this exposes opportunities for methodological and computational refinement. We regard such openness as essential for collaborative science and actively encourage feedback from the research community to enhance analytical rigor, efficiency, and robustness. The repository will be continuously maintained and updated to incorporate evolving best practices and new algorithmic developments.

By integrating clinical relevance, computational transparency, and mechanistic insight, this study aims to bridge translational oncology, reproducible computational research, and fundamental oral cancer biology. We anticipate that the publicly available data and methods will facilitate improved diagnostic classification, more informed therapeutic decision-making, and deeper understanding of OSCC—particularly in Chinese and broader East Asian populations—while providing a reusable framework for molecular subtyping studies worldwide.
