# Welcome {.unnumbered}
Here, we report a comprehensive molecular subtyping analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) performed on one of the largest cohorts of Chinese patients assembled to date. To our knowledge, this study provides the first fully open-source, end-to-end analytical pipeline for genomic subtyping of OSCC. All source code, processed datasets, intermediate files, software environments, and detailed documentation are publicly released to maximize transparency, facilitate independent validation, and promote community-driven refinement.
We acknowledge that complete openness of the codebase exposes opportunities for methodological and computational improvement. We view this as a deliberate and necessary step toward collaborative science and actively encourage feedback from the research community to strengthen analytical rigor, efficiency, and robustness. The accompanying repository will be continuously maintained and updated to reflect evolving best practices and new algorithmic developments.
This work is designed to serve multiple audiences: (i) clinicians managing oral cancer, (ii) genomicists and bioinformatics researchers, and (iii) investigators elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of oral cavity malignancies. The Results section emphasizes concise, clinically actionable findings, including subtype prevalence, defining molecular features, prognostic associations, subtype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities, and prioritized candidate targets—all aimed at accelerating precision oncology strategies for this patient population.

## Reproducible research
Reproducibility of the complete analytical workflow represents a primary goal of this study, with particular emphasis placed on the needs of the genomics and bioinformatics communities. A dedicated, version-controlled companion repository is provided alongside the manuscript. It contains:

fully scripted, end-to-end bioinformatics workflows
exhaustive documentation of data preprocessing and quality-control steps
exact software versions, dependency lists, and containerized environments (Docker/Singularity) where applicable
all parameter settings and random seeds employed
intermediate and final datasets sufficient for bit-for-bit replication

These resources enable any qualified research group to independently regenerate virtually all figures, tables, and statistical results reported herein when starting from the same raw or processed input data.
By integrating clinical relevance, computational transparency, and mechanistic insight, this study seeks to bridge translational oncology, reproducible computational research, and fundamental oral cancer biology. We anticipate that the openly available data and methods will support improved diagnostic classification, refined therapeutic decision-making, and deeper understanding of OSCC, particularly in Chinese and East Asian populations, while providing a reusable framework for molecular subtyping studies worldwide.
