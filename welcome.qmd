# Welcome {.unnumbered}
This study presents a comprehensive molecular subtyping analysis of Oral Carcinoma based on one of the largest cohorts of Chinese patients reported to date. To our knowledge, this work also represents the first fully open-source release of the complete analytical pipeline for Oral Carcinoma genomic subtyping, with all code, processed data, and intermediate files publicly available to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and community validation.
Although making the entire codebase openly accessible inevitably reveals areas for optimization and refinement, we consider this an essential step toward collaborative improvement and warmly welcome suggestions from the scientific community to enhance methodological rigor, computational efficiency, and analytical robustness. The repository will be actively maintained and updated to incorporate emerging best practices and novel algorithmic advances.
The findings are intended to serve clinicians treating Oral Carcinoma, genomicists, bioinformatics researchers, and investigators studying myeloma pathogenesis. The Results section focuses on concise, clinically actionable insights, including the distribution and molecular features of subtypes, their prognostic implications, differential therapeutic vulnerabilities, and candidate targets, with the ultimate goal of facilitating precision oncology approaches in this patient population.

## Reproducible research
A central objective of this work is to enable independent reproduction of virtually all reported results. Reproducibility is accorded the highest priority, particularly for colleagues in genomics and bioinformatics. To this end, a comprehensive companion repository accompanies the manuscript, providing fully documented, end-to-end bioinformatics workflows. This includes detailed descriptions of data preprocessing steps, complete analytical pipelines, exact software versions and dependencies, containerized environments (where applicable), and all parameter settings used throughout the study. These resources are designed to ensure maximal transparency and to allow precise, bit-for-bit replication of our computational findings on identical or equivalent datasets.
By simultaneously addressing the needs of clinical oncologists, computational scientists, and researchers focused on myeloma biology, this study aims to bridge clinical translation, rigorous computational reproducibility, and mechanistic discovery. Ultimately, we seek to advance precision diagnostics, therapeutic decision-making, and biological understanding of Oral Carcinoma in Chinese patient populations and beyond.
