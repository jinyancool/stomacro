title: "The Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma  Project"

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Jiong Lv for his generous collaboration and visionary leadership throughout this Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) project.

Our collaboration originated from a series of inspiring discussions on the remarkable progress achieved in the molecular classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) and T-cell ALL (T-ALL)[@RN4; @RN2], large-scale integrative genomic, transcriptomic, and pharmacogenomic studies have successfully established robust, clinically actionable subtypes, dramatically improving diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and the implementation of precision therapies (including CD19/CD22-directed immunotherapies, BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitors, and MEK/PI3K pathway-targeted agents) [@RN3; @RN1].

During these exchanges, Professor Lv shared his profound insights into the unique spatial molecular landscape of OSCC. He emphasized that, unlike Western cohorts dominated by HPV-negative, tobacco/alcohol-driven disease, a substantial proportion of OSCC in China and neighboring countries arises on the background of betel nut chewing, oral submucous fibrosis, and distinct genetic/epigenetic drivers, resulting in more aggressive invasive fronts, earlier lymph node metastasis, and different immune microenvironment compositions. These population-specific features have not been adequately captured by existing TCGA-based or Western-centric molecular frameworks, leading to suboptimal prognostic models and limited benefit from current targeted and immune therapies in Asian patients.

Inspired by the success of multi-omics-driven subtyping in leukemia, Professor Lv proposed a bold collaborative initiative: to establish the first comprehensive, spatially resolved molecular taxonomy of resectable OSCC in a large Chinese cohort, leveraging cutting-edge spatial multi-omics platforms (Tenx, Xenium, CosMx, and CODEX) alongside deep clinical annotation. He envisioned that methodological frameworks successfully applied in ALL, such as integrative clustering, immune deconvolution, and pharmacotranscriptomic modeling, could be powerfully adapted to decode the spatial organization of tumor–stroma interactions, hypoxia gradients, and immune exclusion zones that critically determine recurrence risk after curative-intent surgery in OSCC.

This visionary proposal directly catalyzed the present study described herein. With Professor Lv’s unwavering intellectual guidance and resource support, we have now completed the largest spatially multi-omics characterization of Chinese resectable OSCC to date, providing an open, reproducible framework that we believe will substantially advance precision oncology for this devastating disease in high-incidence Asian populations.

Once again, I extend my most sincere appreciation to Professor Jiong Lv for his trust, insight, and enduring partnership. This work stands as a testament to the transformative impact of cross-disease, cross-institutional collaboration in tackling unmet clinical challenges.
