# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) represents the most common malignancy of the oral cavity and remains a major public health challenge in many regions, particularly in East Asia where incidence rates are among the highest worldwide. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy, long-term survival has improved only modestly over the past decades, underscoring the need for a deeper molecular understanding to enable precision oncology approaches.

In this study, we performed comprehensive molecular subtyping of OSCC in one of the largest comprehensively profiled Chinese patient cohorts reported to date. By integrating multi-omics data with detailed clinical annotation, we aimed to define robust, clinically relevant subtypes, elucidate their biological drivers, and identify subtype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities.

The following sections and accompanying Supplementary Materials describe the complete analytical workflow—from raw data acquisition and rigorous quality control through integrative clustering, downstream interpretation, and independent validation. All computational steps were implemented in a fully scripted, version-controlled, and containerized pipeline that is publicly released to ensure maximal transparency and reproducibility. We provide all source code, processed datasets, intermediate files, software environments, and detailed documentation in a dedicated repository[](https://github.com/jinyancool/stomacro).

We anticipate that the molecular framework and open analytical resources presented here will facilitate refined diagnostic classification, inform treatment decision-making, and accelerate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for OSCC, particularly in East Asian populations.
