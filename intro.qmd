# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the predominant malignancy of the oral cavity, accounting for over 90% of cases and posing a substantial global health burden, particularly in high-incidence regions such as East Asia. Characterized by aggressive local invasion, regional lymph node metastasis, and a 5-year survival rate hovering around 50%, OSCC arises from a complex interplay of environmental risk factors (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and betel nut use), genetic predispositions, and chronic inflammatory processes in the oral mucosa. For resectable OSCC, defined as tumors amenable to complete surgical excision (typically stages I-III without distant metastasis), multidisciplinary treatment involving surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and selective chemotherapy has modestly improved locoregional control. However, recurrence rates exceed 30-40%, and the lack of reliable prognostic biomarkers hinders personalized therapeutic decision-making, underscoring the imperative for deeper insights into tumor biology.

## Multi Omics

Advances in omics technologies have revolutionized our understanding of OSCC pathogenesis by unveiling molecular heterogeneity beyond traditional histopathological grading. Genomic studies, leveraging next-generation sequencing, have identified recurrent mutations in key driver genes, including TP53 (mutated in 50-80% of cases), NOTCH1, CDKN2A, FAT1, and CASP8, which disrupt cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways. Transcriptomic analyses, often derived from bulk RNA sequencing of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts, have delineated mesenchymal, classical, and basal/immune subtypes, associating the mesenchymal subtype with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), poor prognosis, and resistance to radiotherapy. Proteomic and metabolomic profiling via mass spectrometry has further highlighted dysregulated signaling (e.g., EGFR and PI3K/AKT activation) and metabolic reprogramming, such as elevated glycolysis and polyamine synthesis, which fuel tumor proliferation and immune evasion. Integrated multi-omics approaches, combining genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics (e.g., DNA methylation of tumor suppressors), and proteomics, have stratified patients into clinically actionable subtypes, revealing inverse correlations between immune-hot markers (e.g., APOBEC3A) and oncogenic drivers (e.g., EGFR amplification on chromosome 7p11.2), with implications for immunotherapy response and targeted therapies like cetuximab. Salivary proteomics has emerged as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, identifying panels of biomarkers (e.g., S100A9, CSTA) for early OSCC detection, while single-cell RNA sequencing has exposed intratumoral heterogeneity, including rare cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subpopulations that promote stromal invasion. These discoveries have informed precision oncology, yet bulk and dissociated single-cell omics overlook the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME), where cell-cell interactions, gradients of hypoxia, and immune infiltration dictate therapeutic vulnerability in resectable lesions.

## Spatial Multi Omics

Spatial multi-omics addresses this critical gap by preserving tissue context, enabling high-resolution mapping of molecular profiles to histological features such as tumor cores, invasive fronts, and stromal interfaces—key determinants of surgical outcomes in resectable OSCC. Platforms like 10x Genomics Visium (spatial indexing-based, ~55-μm resolution, whole-transcriptome coverage), Xenium (in situ hybridization with rolling-circle amplification, subcellular resolution for 100-5,000 genes), NanoString CosMx (in situ imaging for ~1,000 genes plus proteins, single-cell scale), and CODEX (cyclic immunofluorescence for 50+ proteins, single-cell phenotyping) collectively facilitate unbiased discovery and targeted interrogation. Visium has profiled OSCC tumor cores versus leading edges, revealing conserved transcriptomic architectures enriched in EMT and hypoxia signatures at invasion fronts, which correlate with survival and anti-EGFR therapy response. Xenium's subcellular precision has illuminated CAF-tumor interactions in OSCC-derived from oral submucous fibrosis, highlighting polyamine metabolism hubs that drive progression and immune exclusion. CosMx, with its protein co-detection, has enabled same-slide multi-omics in head and neck cancers, identifying spatially restricted ligand-receptor pairs (e.g., CXCL12-CXCR4) that sustain immunosuppressive niches, informing checkpoint blockade strategies. CODEX, focusing on proteomics, has delineated immune landscapes in OSCC biopsies, quantifying myeloid-derived suppressor cells at tumor-stroma borders and linking their density to recurrence risk post-resection.

The importance of spatial multi-omics in resectable OSCC cannot be overstated: it deciphers how spatial gradients—e.g., oxidative stress signaling from CAFs to tumor cells—promote post-surgical relapse, while integrating with AI-driven modeling enhances prognostic stratification and vulnerability mapping. By revealing subtype-specific therapeutic targets, such as PARP inhibitors for DNA repair-deficient edges or bispecific antibodies against spatially enriched receptors, these technologies pave the way for adjuvant precision therapies that extend disease-free survival. This study employs an integrated spatial multi-omics pipeline across Visium, Xenium, CosMx, and CODEX to profile resectable OSCC TMEs, aiming to define spatially resolved subtypes, uncover actionable drivers, and validate vulnerabilities in East Asian cohorts for optimized surgical-oncologic paradigms.
